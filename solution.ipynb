    "So far, we were only interested in `semantic` classes, e.g. foreground / background etc.\n",
    "But in many cases we not only want to know if a certain pixel belongs to a specific class, but also to which unique object (i.e. the task of `instance segmentation`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For isolated objects, this is trivial, all connected foreground pixels form one instance, yet often instances are very close together or even overlapping. Thus we need to think a bit more how to formulate the targets / loss of our network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, in instance segmentation the specific value of each label is arbitrary. Here we label each cell with a number and assign a color to each number giving us a segmentation mask. `Mask 1` and `Mask 2` are equivalently good segmentations even though the specific label of each cell is arbitrary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once again: THE SPECIFIC VALUES OF THE LABELS ARE ARBITRARY\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the model will not be able to learn, if tasked to predict the labels directly.\n",

    "Therefore we split the task of instance segmentation in two and introduce an intermediate target which must be:\n",
    "  1) learnable\n",
    "  2) post-processable into an instance segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will go over two common intermediate targets (signed distance transform and affinities),\n",
    "as well as the necessary pre and post-processing for obtaining the final segmentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the exercise we will also compare to a pre-trained cellpose model."

    "    - Easy post-processing. We can do a simple watershed to get an initial segmentation. And then we can compute the average affinity between each pair of labels. This is very powerful for processing huge objects in small pieces.\n",
    "- Cons:\n",
    "    - Extreme class imbalance. The affinities are only 0 between objects and in background. This means networks can often learn to predict 1s everywhere and be mostly correct. Thus we always use some form of weighted loss when training affinities.\n",

I won't dive too much into the details, but it is similar to watershed except that it allows edges to have negative weights and for splits, removing the need for finding seed points.\n",
    "However this does mean we now need a bias term since if we give it all positive edges (our affinities are in range (0, 1)) everything will join into a single object. Thus our bias should be in range (-1, 0), such that we have some positive and some negative affinities.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also be useful to bias long range affinities more negatively than the short range affinities. The intuition here being that boundaries are often blurry in biology. This means it may not be easy to tell if the neighboring pixel has crossed a boundary, but it is reasonably easy to tell if there is a boundary accross a 5 pixel gap. Similarly, identifying if two pixels belong to the same object is easier, the closer they are to each other. Providing a more negative bias to long range affinities means we bias towards splitting on low long range affinities, and merging on high short range affinities."
